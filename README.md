# Sysmon-Wazuh
The primary goal of this project is to implement a comprehensive and scalable security monitoring solution for Windows endpoint. By leveraging Sysmon for advanced system activity logging and Wazuh for log aggregation, correlation, and analysis, this project aims to improve threat detection capabilities, support incident response, and enhance the overall security visibility within an organization’s IT environment.

Utilized Tools: 
- [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)
- [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html)
- [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/docs)

Benefits and Outcomes:
- **Improved Endpoint Visibility:** In-depth insights into endpoint behaviors and anomalies.
- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Faster detection and response to suspicious activities.
- **Customizable Detection Rules:** Ability to define and update detection logic as threats evolve.
- **Centralized Monitoring:** Unified view of endpoint security events from all Windows systems.
- **Open-Source Cost Efficiency:** Achieved enterprise-grade monitoring using open-source tools without commercial licensing costs.

Future Enhancements:
- Integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or SOAR platforms for automated incident response.
- Continuously update Sysmon configs and Wazuh rules based on threat intelligence feeds.
- Apply machine learning for anomaly detection over time.

In conclusion, this project proves the effectiveness of Sysmon and Wazuh as a reliable, open-source monitoring stack for Windows environments. It equips security practitioners with a strong foundation for detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats, and offers numerous opportunities for future growth—ranging from automation and machine learning integration to cloud and hybrid deployment. With further refinement, this solution can evolve into a full-featured Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform tailored to a wide range of operational and research environments.
